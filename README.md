# SOfIoTS Common Core Ontology
The SOfIoTS Common Core Ontology was developed as part of the [SOfIoTS](https://petras-iot.org/project/secure-ontologies-for-iot-systems-sofiots/) project, which forms of the [PETRAS National Centre of Excellence for IoT Systems Security](https://petras-iot.org/). The ontology is intended to support the representation of risk and security in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). It also includes support for the representation of IoT devices, digital twins, and IoT data flows. 

The SOfIoTS CCO is intended to to be compliant with the overarching architectural framework of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). To this end, it builds on the following ontologies:

* **Basic Formal Ontology** ([https://github.com/BFO-ontology](https://github.com/BFO-ontology)).
* **The Common Core Ontologies** (see [https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies](https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies)).
* **The Common Core Cyber Ontology** (see [https://opensource.ieee.org/cyber-ontology-working-group](https://opensource.ieee.org/cyber-ontology-working-group)).

These ontologies serve as the basis for the following ontologies, each of which is intended to provide suppport for the representation of risk and security terms in an IoT context:

* **Value Ontology:** The value ontology is designed to represent value-related entities, such as assets, situation objectives, valued objects, and value-related events.
* **Risk and Security Ontology:** The risk and security ontology is designed to represent risk- and security-related entities, such as threat processes, threat paths, hazardous situations, and security mechanisms.
* **Internet of Things Ontology:** The IoT ontology is intended to represent IoT devices, digital twins, and IoT data flows.

At the present time, all the aforementioned ontologies are contained in a single (merged) ontology: [SOFIOTS_CCO_Merged.owl](SOFIOTS_CCO_Merged.owl).

The documentation folder contains the following files:

* SOfIoTS Ontology Documention.pdf: Documentation for a subset of the classes and relations asserted in [SOFIOTS_CCO_Merged.owl](SOFIOTS_CCO_Merged.owl).
* [SOfIoTS D4 Reportv2.pdf](Documentation/SOfIoTS%20D4%20Reportv2.pdf): Discusses the results of work exploring the ontic status of value, risk, and security from a BFO perspective.
